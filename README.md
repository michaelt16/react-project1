# COMP 4513 REACT MOVIE APP


## **Description**
This web apps allows the browsing, favoriting and filtering of movies

## **Developing**
`main` will be used as the production branch. We should only be adding code to the `main` branch by merging in feature branches.

### Feature Branches
When creating/editing a feature, open a new branch. Any name will do, but it should be intuitive and easy to understand. For example, `feature/add-member` is good.

Once the feature is implemented, open a pull request for that branch. The other person will review it and decide if it's good to be merged in, or request changes to be made.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm start
```
